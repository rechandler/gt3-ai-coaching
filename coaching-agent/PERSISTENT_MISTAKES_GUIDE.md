# Persistent Mistake Tracking Guide
## Focus on Recurring Issues, Not One-Off Mistakes

### Overview

The Persistent Mistake Tracking System identifies recurring problems that need focused attention rather than one-off mistakes. It provides session summaries with frequency analysis, cost analysis, and trend tracking to help drivers focus on the most important improvements.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Frequency Analysis**
- Tracks how often each mistake occurs
- Identifies patterns vs. one-off errors
- Prioritizes persistent issues over random mistakes

#### 2. **Cost Analysis**
- Calculates total time lost per mistake type
- Identifies most costly mistakes
- Provides average time loss per occurrence

#### 3. **Trend Tracking**
- Monitors if mistakes are improving, stable, or declining
- Tracks severity trends over time
- Identifies areas getting worse vs. better

#### 4. **Session Summaries**
- Comprehensive session analysis
- Most common and costly mistakes
- Improvement areas and recommendations
- Session quality scoring

### Components

#### 1. **MistakeTracker**
Main tracking engine that monitors mistake frequency and patterns.

#### 2. **MistakeClassifier**
Classifies mistakes into categories (timing, speed, technique, line, consistency).

#### 3. **MistakeEvent**
Individual mistake with timestamp, severity, and context.

#### 4. **MistakePattern**
Recurring mistake pattern with frequency and trend analysis.

#### 5. **SessionSummary**
Comprehensive session analysis with recommendations.

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Integration

```python
from mistake_tracker import MistakeTracker

# Initialize tracker
tracker = MistakeTracker("session_123")

# Add mistakes from analysis
analysis_data = {
    'brake_timing_delta': 0.1,
    'apex_speed_delta': -3.0,
    'total_time_loss': 0.25,
    'detected_patterns': ['late_brake']
}

tracker.add_mistake(
    analysis_data=analysis_data,
    corner_id="spa_eau_rouge",
    corner_name="Eau Rouge"
)

# Get persistent mistakes
persistent = tracker.get_persistent_mistakes()
for pattern in persistent:
    print(f"{pattern.corner_name}: {pattern.mistake_type} "
          f"({pattern.frequency} times, {pattern.total_time_loss:.1f}s lost)")
```

#### Integration with Coaching Agent

```python
from hybrid_coach import HybridCoachingAgent

# Initialize coaching agent (includes mistake tracking)
agent = HybridCoachingAgent(config)

# Process telemetry (mistakes are automatically tracked)
telemetry_data = {
    'speed': 120,
    'brake': 60,
    'throttle': 0,
    'steering': 0.3,
    'lap_distance_pct': 0.25,
    'track_name': 'Spa-Francorchamps'
}

agent.process_telemetry(telemetry_data)

# Get persistent mistakes
persistent_mistakes = agent.get_persistent_mistakes()

# Get session summary
session_summary = agent.get_session_summary()
```

### Mistake Classification

The system classifies mistakes into categories:

#### 1. **Timing Mistakes**
- `late_brake`: Braking too late
- `early_brake`: Braking too early
- `late_throttle`: Throttle too late
- `early_throttle`: Throttle too early
- `poor_gear_selection`: Wrong gear for corner

#### 2. **Speed Mistakes**
- `low_entry_speed`: Entry speed too low
- `high_entry_speed`: Entry speed too high
- `low_apex_speed`: Apex speed too low
- `high_apex_speed`: Apex speed too high
- `low_exit_speed`: Exit speed too low

#### 3. **Technique Mistakes**
- `understeer`: Understeer detected
- `oversteer`: Oversteer detected
- `off_throttle_oversteer`: Off-throttle oversteer
- `trail_braking_poor`: Poor trail braking
- `inconsistent_inputs`: Inconsistent inputs

#### 4. **Line Mistakes**
- `early_apex`: Apex too early
- `late_apex`: Apex too late
- `poor_racing_line`: Poor racing line
- `line_deviation`: Significant line deviation

#### 5. **Consistency Mistakes**
- `lap_time_variance`: Inconsistent lap times
- `sector_time_variance`: Inconsistent sector times
- `input_variance`: Inconsistent inputs

### Priority System

Mistakes are prioritized based on frequency and cost:

#### **Critical Priority**
- Frequency: 5+ occurrences
- Average time loss: 0.3s+
- Examples: "You consistently lose 0.2s at Turn 8 exit"

#### **High Priority**
- Frequency: 3+ occurrences
- Average time loss: 0.2s+
- Examples: "Late braking at Turn 1 (3 times, 0.6s lost)"

#### **Medium Priority**
- Frequency: 2+ occurrences
- Average time loss: 0.1s+
- Examples: "Inconsistent apex speeds at Turn 5"

#### **Low Priority**
- Frequency: 1 occurrence
- Average time loss: 0.05s+
- Examples: "One-off early brake at Turn 3"

### Session Summary Features

#### 1. **Most Common Mistakes**
- Ranked by frequency
- Shows which mistakes occur most often
- Helps identify recurring patterns

#### 2. **Most Costly Mistakes**
- Ranked by total time lost
- Shows which mistakes cost the most time
- Helps prioritize improvements

#### 3. **Improvement Areas**
- Identifies key areas for focus
- Combines frequency and cost analysis
- Provides actionable targets

#### 4. **Recommendations**
- Specific advice based on patterns
- Prioritized by impact
- Focuses on persistent issues
